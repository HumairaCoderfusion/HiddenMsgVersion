# üìå Project: Image Steganography (LSB Technique with AES Encryption)
# üîç Description:
#    This script hides text inside an image using the least significant bit (LSB) method.
#    It uses the AES encryption algorithm for encrypting and decrypting the text before embedding it.
#    The text is first encrypted with a password using AES, then converted to binary.
#    The binary data is hidden in the least significant bits of the image's RGB channels.
#    The encrypted text can be extracted from the image using the LSB method and decrypted
#    using the password to reveal the original text.
#
# üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies:
#    - cryptography (for AES encryption) ‚Üí Install using: pip install cryptography
#    - Pillow (PIL) ‚Üí Install using: pip install pillow
