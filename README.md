## Features

- Hide text messages within images
- Extract hidden text from images
- Password protection for hidden messages
- Modern and responsive web interface
- Works entirely in the browser (no server required)

## How to Use

   - Select an image containing hidden text
   - Enter the password used to hide the text
   - Click "Extract Text"
   - View the extracted message

## Technical Details
